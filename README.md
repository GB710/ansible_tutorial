# ansible_tutorial

This brief Ansible tutorial provides a quick introduction to some fundamental concepts that helped me get started with automation and configuration management. It covers key concepts and actions that are useful for managing systems efficiently.

Key Concepts
Inventory: Ansible uses an inventory file to define the target systems. It can be a list of IP addresses or hostnames of the servers you want to manage.

Playbooks: Playbooks are YAML files that define a series of tasks to be executed on target systems. Each task performs a specific action, such as installing packages, copying files, or restarting services.

Tasks: Tasks are the smallest units of work in Ansible. They define the actions you want to perform on the target systems.

Roles: Roles are a way to organize playbooks and tasks in a more modular and reusable manner. They encapsulate related tasks and variables.
